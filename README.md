### Features:
#### Battery Monitoring (WIP):
- Currently I have basic information such as the battery's percentage, and whether it's charging or not.
#### Build Properties / Kernel Info (WIP): 
- I have basic build.prop information being displayed.
- Relevant kernel information is displayed if a user has installed Shizuku, the service is running, and has granted the permission.
#### Storage Information:
- Provides information pertaining to ram usage and storage consumption.

### Proposed Features:
#### In-scope: 
##### Battery Health (Extended):
- Provide a means to check the temperature of the devices battery.
- Implement a graph-chart visual to represent the fluctuations or differences in real-time.

##### User Registry / Account Login:
- Provide a means of account registry and authentication.
- Provide an in-app updater, or some type of notification system that let's users know when an update is available.

#### Out of Scope:
- Forum implementation: To allow users to share their discoveries, comment, and like other user submissions.
- CPU Temp monitoring: For the same reason as battery monitoring though I am uncertain whether I have time currently.
  
### Installation:
#### For developers:
```git clone https://github.com/StreetwiseGamgee/Cooperative-Demo-1.git```
#### For users:
Will implement an apk for general use in the near future.

### How-to Contribute:
- Within the app there is a feedback section to which users can contact me.
